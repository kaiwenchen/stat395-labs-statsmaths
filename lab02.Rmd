## Instructions

The format for this lab will mirror the majority of labs for
this semester. I have a section here which loads in various
libraries (if some are new, there will also be code to install
them) and then loads a dataset of interest. Your goal is to
predict the value of the third column (which will be missing
on the test set) using the techniques we have learned so far.
In this case, please restrict yourself to univariate linear
regressions.

The lab should be written as short code snippets with surrounding
text. The text should be in full sentences and should fully describe
what and why you are running the code you are running.  When there
are results, you should also give a sentence or two describing them.

Make sure to include at a minimum several plots and argue for why
you chose your final model.

You may not share code with other students prior to the submission
of each lab. However, discussing the labs amongst other students
is allowed. Also, copying and pasting my code from class or
prior submissions you made is **not** considered plagiarism and
is in fact highly encouraged. With permission, I may occasionally
post student-solutions to past labs. These are also fair game
for copying code from (though please do not excessively copy the
expository text). If in doubt, please ask me before submitting
results.

## Set up

Your first step should be to read in the following libraries:

```{r}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(viridis)
```

And to load the abalone dataset:

```{r}
abalone <- read_csv("https://statsmaths.github.io/ml_data/abalone.csv")
```

An abalone is a particular type of shellfish; I find it rather
funny looking:

Your goal is to use physical characteristics from a set of abalone
to predict the shellfish's age.

Your code and text should go in the section below (feel free to create
sub-sections with the `###` command at the start of line, though please
note that this is not required):

## Lab 02

The goal here is to predict the age variable. We see that this variable
is roughly normally distributed with a mode around 10 years:

```{r}
qplot(age, data = abalone)
```

Looking at a number of variables, it visually appears that the `sheel_weight`
variable is the most predictive. That is, points deviate from the line the
least:

```{r}
qplot(sheel_weight, age, data = abalone) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

(NOTE: Usually, I would use some proper validation techniques to evaluate this
model, but for now a visual argument is fine. Also, I may be wrong about
which variable looks the most predictive; it is just a feeling after looking
at a few plots. Other choices are not necessarily wrong.)

As we only know how to do univariate models at this point, I will just
fit a univariate model using `sheel_weight` to predict age.

```{r}
model <- lm(age ~ sheel_weight, data = abalone)
abalone$age_pred <- predict(model, newdata = abalone)
```

Usually I would finish by showing the RMSE of my prediction on the training
set, but as mentioned above we haven't covered that yet so there is not much
more to say.


## Submission

The code below assumes that you have adding a prediction named
`age_pred` to every row of the `abalone` dataset.

```{r}
submit <- select(abalone, obs_id, age_pred)
write_csv(submit, "class02_submit.csv")
```

Now, upload this file (ends with ".Rmd"), the HTML output
(ends with ".nb.html"), and the csv file to GitHub.
