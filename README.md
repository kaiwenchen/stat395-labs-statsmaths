# Statistics 395: Lab Files

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Completion-3/28-orange.svg)

This repository is where you will find starter code for your daily labs
and is a place to put your completed lab files. Note that these labs
are generally open-ended. You'll be graded not just on the
predictiveness of your model but also how well you complete all of
the required tasks and how well you describe your approach.

**Recall:** Labs are due online 90 minutes before class starts
(noon on Tuesdays and Thursdays). You should receive your prediction
accuracy in the file `grades.md` by the start of class. Three time
throughout the semester, I will give batch feedback and a letter grade
for labs in that third of the course.

**Note:** Most datasets we look at are publicly available. It is strictly
forbidden to try to access these in order to make your predictions.
Please also refrain from using packages and models we have not yet
covered in the course. However, you are more than welcome to consult
external references for how to approach a specific problem. You may
also try to tweak parameters to various models that we have not yet
discussed. If in doubt, please contact me before submitting something.

We will cover this interactively in class, but here are the steps
for completing labs for future reference:

1. I will send a link to your e-mail that you should follow
and accept. Assuming you have a valid GitHub account, this
will set up a repository where all of your labs for this semester
should be posted.
2. Select the lab you would like to work on (`lab01.Rmd` here)
and click on the link.
3. Now, click on the **Raw** button. This should take you to
the raw notebook file. Download this through your browser somewhere
on your computer.
4. Open this file in RStudio and work through the questions.
5. When you are finished, select the `Knit to HTML` button. This
should create an html file in the same location that you saved
the Rmd file. You should also have a file `class01_submit.csv`
in the same location.
6. Return to GitHub and drag and drop the three files into your
respository. Commit these to the repository with the **Commit changes**
button and then you are done! If dragging and dropping does not work
(only officially support on Chrome I believe), select **Upload files**
and do so manually.
7. There should already be a `lab02.Rmd` for you to work on for the
next class. New labs will show up automatically as we proceed through
the semester.
